        <h2>WHAT IS CSS?</h2>
    </div>
    <p style="color: blue;">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.</p>
    <p style="color: brown;">With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elemetns are
        posotioned and laid out, <br>
        what background images or background colors are to be used, diffrent display for diffrent devices and screen
        size, and much more!
    </p>

    <div style="color:black; background-color: burlywood;">
        <b>Tip:</b> the word <b>cascading</b> means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all
        children elements within the parent. <br>
        So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within
        the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!
